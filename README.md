# Simple Interpolator
This is a simple video frame interpolator for linux, built on the great RIFE

## About
A while ago I was looking for a way to raise the frame rate of a lot of old MP4s, but I never found a satisfactory solution. I came across such popular software as Topaz Video AI (great program by the way) or FlowFrames; and despite the high quality of these programs, they were a selection of slow, (V)RAM hungry, prone to errors, and expensive.
